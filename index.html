    <h1>Hello Butterflies!</h1>
    <p>
Beyond the familiar Monarch, a dazzling array of butterfly species graces diverse habitats with unique colors and forms. For instance, the Swallowtail family (Papilionidae) boasts large, colorful wings, many with distinctive, tail-like extensions. The Black Swallowtail, with its black wings accented by rows of yellow spots and blue bands, is a striking example. In contrast, the whites and sulphurs (Pieridae) are often small to medium-sized, displaying delicate hues of white or yellow, sometimes with orange wingtips or greenish marbling.
Beyond these well-known groups, families like the Brush-footed butterflies (Nymphalidae) exhibit extraordinary diversity in color and pattern, including the vibrant blues of Morpho butterflies. The Metalmarks (Riodinidae), while less numerous in the United States, show a staggering variety worldwide, with the vast majority thriving in Latin America. Each species, from the fast-flying Skippers to the slower, more deliberate glides of the Swallowtails, has evolved unique traits, including coloration patterns like the yellow bands of the male Black Swallowtail compared to the female's row of yellow dots and blue band, notes the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. This rich tapestry of appearances reflects the specialized adaptations each butterfly has made to its environment and lifestyle.
